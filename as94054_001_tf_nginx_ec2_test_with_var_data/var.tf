##One should not use variable for region
##Because the tfstate file gets updated with the region you pass while running "terraform apply" command.
##Think you created an EC2 instance with us-east-1 for first occurence and us-west-2 for the second occurence.
##When you try destroy us-east-1 instance, tf will have no idea because tfstate file will get updated with us-west-2 region.check "
